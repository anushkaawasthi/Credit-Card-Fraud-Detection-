# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
1. Dataset Description
2. This project focuses on credit card fraud detection. The dataset we are using contains transactional data with both fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities. Each row in the dataset represents a transaction and includes multiple features like transaction amount, time of transaction, and various anonymized variables (V1, V2, ..., V28) generated by PCA. The target variable, Class, indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).
The dataset is publicly available and is commonly used for credit card fraud detection tasks. It has over 284,000 records and 31 features (including the target variable). The dataset is highly imbalanced, as the number of fraudulent transactions is much smaller than the legitimate ones.
 
 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset contains transaction records from a financial institution, including features that describe transaction amounts, types, timestamps, and other details. The dataset is imbalanced, with a significantly smaller number of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones.
1. Data Overview:
• Number of observations: 284,807
• Number of features: 30
• Target variable: Class (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate transactions)
• Feature Types: All features are numerical, including time-based and amount-based variables.
2. Distribution of the Target Variable:
The target variable Class is highly imbalanced:
• Fraudulent transactions: 492
• Legitimate transactions: 284,315
This imbalance requires careful handling, likely using resampling methods such as SMOTE or adjusting class weights in our algorithms.
3. Feature Correlation:
• Initial correlation analysis shows that most features are uncorrelated, with some having high multicollinearity, requiring further investigation.
• No significant correlation between the target variable and other individual features was observed, indicating the need for advanced techniques to uncover patterns.
4. Distribution of Transaction Amounts:
• The Amount feature follows a highly skewed distribution, with most transactions falling below $100. We'll apply transformations (log-scaling) for better analysis.
5. Time-Based Features:
• The Time feature measures the time elapsed between the first transaction in the dataset and the current transaction. It does not exhibit a clear relationship with fraudulent activities based on initial analysis.
 
3. Algorithms
Our task is a classification problem, where we aim to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. We intend to apply the following algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification.
2. Random Forest: To leverage the power of decision trees and handle the imbalance in the dataset.
3. XGBoost: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its high accuracy and efficiency with imbalanced datasets.
